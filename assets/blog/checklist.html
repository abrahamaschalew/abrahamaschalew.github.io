      My mother says do that and do this. But I never do what she says 100%. I
      always forget it. I tell her don’t worry I can remember. That was a lie.
      At the end of the day I will miss something.

      That’s because our brain is terrible at remembering but good at
      processing. The solution is writing down. There is some magic about
      writing down things. When you write down you will not miss anything.

      When doctors do surgery they write down a checklist to do every step
      right. Otherwise they will screw something.

      Writing a checklist can also help you to remove cognitive energy. When you
      reduce cognitive energy you will have more space to think and handle other
      tasks.

    <p>If it’s too much to process in your head, write it down.</p>
