    <h1 class="blog-title">Getting angry and lost what I know</h1>
    <p>
      Yesterday, I started working on an angular project. After using react for
      a month. I created the project. After some minutes I want to create an
      angular component using angular-cli.
    </p>

    <p>Then I go back into the terminal and type this.</p>

    <p>$ ng n c components/header</p>

    <p>I got an error It say</p>

    <p>
      >> The new command requires to be run outside of a project, but a project
        definition was found at "/home/abraham/code/angular …/angular.json</p

    </p>

    <p>
      Then I say to myself what the hell? I just want an angular component and I
      don’t have to run outside from the project. It does not work.
    </p>

    <p>
      As usual I just paste the error in google. And I get some stackoverflow
      and github pages. I looked at them and I found nothing.
    </p>

    <p>Now I start getting angry. Because I did it millions of times before.</p>
    <p>
      I was overconfident that I know what I’m doing. After a 30 minutes battle
      with myself. I look at what I wrote in my terminal and I notice I use “n”
      instead of “g”. It takes me a millisecond to realize my mistake. I say Ohh
      shit, Are you kidding me, how I don’t see this?
    </p>

    <p>
      The answer was being overconfident and getting angry. Without thinking
      again what I type.
    </p>

    <p>
      The “n” argument is used for creating a new project. And “g” is for
      generating components, modules, and services. In this case I have to use
      “g” in order to create a new component.Then I change it to “g” and it
      works.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every programmer has these kinds of moments, not just one time, a dozen
      times. The best way to deal with them is calming yourself and thinking
      again about what we wrote.

    <p>The computer was never wrong. We are.</p>
