      Write your program with a messy code first then refactor it
    </h1>
    <p>
      You have a big problem in your head. Solving with clean code is impossible
      until you write your first messy code. After the program work. It's easy
      to refactor each block of a code. Because you know what every code does.
    </p>

    <p>
      But starting to solve the problem with clean code leads to other problems.
      Writing clean code itself is another problem. When you try to solve these
      two problems in parallel make the problem worse.
    </p>

    <p>
      My advice is itâ€™s okay to write messy code to solve a problem. You always
      have an opportunity to refactor it.
    </p>

    <p>By the way this is the professional way to do it.</p>
